PixelFarm/src
---

This folder contains a Main project solution file(_MiniDev.sln_)


**PixelFarm** : contains PixelFarm sub projects

**Tests** : contains test projects

**Tools** : contains '_BuildMergeProject_' tool that we use it to built the 'autogen' projects

**x_merge_projects** : contains original 'autogen' project _outline_

**x_autogen_* **: contain projects that are auto-generated by our tool '_BuildMergeProject_'

---

**How projects are arranged?**
 

I separate the main projects into many sub _solution folders_ =>

Because it is easy to do _dependency analysis_.

_part1_



**0.1 DevTests** :  contains tests and examples

**0.9 WebDocuments**: contains modules that are needed by PaintLab.Svg, we shared the source with HtmlRender project.

**1.0_Supportive Modules**: modules that support platform's functionality.

**1.1_MiniOpenTK:** contains custom version of OpenTK



**2.0_Shaped_Images:** about shapes, geometry, tesselation, and image codecs

**2.1_Core:** contains drawing core, how to render an individual pixel to a bitmap's memory. 

**2.2_Production:** merge all functions of *2.0 and 2.1* to a single dll here=> PixelFarm.Drawing.
                    with PixelFarm.Drawing alone, we can create an in-memory bitmap canvas and 
					draw anything to it. This is a pure software-renderer.					

**3.0_Typography:** the PixelFarm.Drawing alone dose not have text-drawing function directly.
				  drawing a text span is a complex part, I separate this part to another repo 'Typography'.
				  PixelFarm provide a 'text-printer' interface, we implement that text-printer inside
				  PixelFarm.Typography.

_part2_ 
 
 **4.0_Specific_Drawing:** specific platform drawing, as describe above,
        PixelFarm.Drawing contains only Software Rendering part.
		the code for platform-specific-drawing functions is here.
						   
the module GdiPlus, GLES implement PixelFarm.Drawing's Painter,Drawboard
and add platform specific drawing function to it. 
						   
Painter's user can choose to use platform-specific or pure software-renderer.
						   
for examples, GLES module use GLES painter by default, but
if user want to draw a some fine graphics object (eg. font glyphs)
they can draw it to software-base surface and copy to GLES surface
						   
						   						   
						   
**5.0_PaintLab_Platform:** contains RenderTree and other graphics support module (Color,PaintFx)					   
RenderTree contains essential functions for UI implementation (eg. HitTest,
event-tree, graphics update cycle implementation)

**5.1_Your_Implementation:** as it name, this part provide 'example' for PaintLab's RenderTree.
                          it demonstrate how to create a low level UIElement,
						  binding UI interaction etc, you can reimlement this all by your own.
						  
**5.2_Specific_Implementation:** module for merge 'Your-Implementation' to a specific Platform

**6.0_Tools**: contains '_BuildMergeProject_' tool that we use it to built the 'autogen' projects
